```
Farmers ─┬─── Farm Records
         ├─── Cooperatives
         └─── Sales Records

Cooperatives ─┬─── Cooperative Managers
              └─── Sales Records

Buyers Records ─── Sales Records

Entity Relationships:
Farmers ↔ Farm Records:

Farmers are linked to Farm Records through Farmer_ID (FK in Farm Records). Each farmer can have multiple Farm Records associated with different farm plots.
The Farm Records contain details about the plot, such as Plot_ID, Plot_Name, District, and Sector, and link to the Farmers via Farmer_ID.
Farmers ↔ Sales Records:

Farmers are linked to Sales Records via Farmer_ID (FK in Sales Records). Farmers generate Sales Records when they sell coffee, capturing details like Kilograms_Sold and Sales_FRW.
Each Sales Record also tracks the Plot_ID (linking back to Farm Records) and Cooperative_ID (indicating the farmer’s cooperative).
Cooperatives ↔ Cooperative Managers:

A Cooperative is managed by one Cooperative Manager. The Cooperative Manager is identified by Manager_ID and is linked to a Cooperative via Manager_ID (FK in Cooperatives).
The Cooperative Manager oversees the Farm Records and ensures that coffee production is aligned with market demand.
Cooperatives ↔ Sales Records:

Cooperatives track the Sales Records through Cooperative_ID (FK in Sales Records). This allows them to aggregate sales data and monitor financial transactions across all associated Farmers.
The Cooperative may also be responsible for reporting on the overall sales data and managing the cooperative’s financial health.
Buyers ↔ Sales Records:

Buyers interact with Sales Records by purchasing coffee. Buyers Records capture Buyer_ID (PK), Business_Name, Owner_Name, and transaction details like Date_Purchased, Quantity_Purchased_KG, and Amount_Spent_FRW.
Sales Records link to Buyers via Buyer_ID (FK) to track all transactions between the cooperative and buyers.

Summary of the Logical Flow:
Farmers record farming activities in the Farm Records and generate Sales Records upon selling coffee to Buyers.
Cooperative Managers oversee both Farm Records and Sales Records, ensuring production aligns with market demand.
The Cooperative System (MIS) serves as a central hub, consolidating data and generating real-time reports for better decision-making.
Buyers purchase coffee and generate sales transactions that feed back into the Sales Records for tracking and financial analysis.
This logical flow ensures all data is interlinked and managed effectively, enabling real-time insights for cooperative managers, better financial management, and improved decision-making.
