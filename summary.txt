Summary of the Logical Flow:
Farmers record farming activities in the Farm Records and generate Sales Records upon selling coffee to Buyers.
Cooperative Managers oversee both Farm Records and Sales Records, ensuring production aligns with market demand.
The Cooperative System (MIS) serves as a central hub, consolidating data and generating real-time reports for better decision-making.
Buyers purchase coffee and generate sales transactions that feed back into the Sales Records for tracking and financial analysis.
This logical flow ensures all data is interlinked and managed effectively, enabling real-time insights for cooperative managers, better financial management, and improved decision-making.
